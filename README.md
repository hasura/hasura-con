# Hasura Con 2020 CFP

Hey there, we are so excited that you're interested in speaking at the first ever Hasura Con (our online Hasura conference)! The talks will be held from 9am - 12 pm PST on 8th, 9th & 10 of June.

This is a conference for our users & the community! We'd love to hear you speak if you are using Hasura in your applications, are part of the community, building tooling around Hasura or work at a company whose products work very well with Hasura!

Talk topic ideas:
* Use-cases & product showcases of applications built with Hasura.
* Insights around using Hasura for the industry that your product is in.
* Reference architecture of your Hasura apps.
* Tooling that you've created that works well with Hasura.
* Product integrations with Hasura (devrels, this one is for you :)).
* Community oriented talks around using Hasura or being a part of the Hasura community.

These are indicative topic themes! Please do submit talks even if they don't fit into these themes!
