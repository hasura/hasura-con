# Hasura Con 2022 CFP

Hey there, HasuraCon - our annual user conference - is back for the 3rd edition in 2022 and CFPs are currently open! This year, HasuraCon will be hosted online between the 28th and 30th of June. 

This is a conference for our users & the community! We'd love to hear you speak if you are using Hasura in your applications, are part of the community, building tooling around Hasura or work at a company whose products work very well with Hasura!

Talk topic ideas:
* Use-cases & product showcases of applications built with Hasura.
* Insights around using Hasura for the industry that your product is in.
* Reference architecture of your Hasura apps.
* Tooling that you've created that works well with Hasura.
* Product integrations with Hasura (devrels, this one is for you :)).
* Community oriented talks around using Hasura or being a part of the Hasura community.

These are indicative topic themes! Please do submit talks even if they don't fit into these themes!
